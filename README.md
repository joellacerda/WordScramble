# WordScramble 🧩  
**WordScramble** is a fun and educational word game designed to challenge your vocabulary and problem-solving skills. Built entirely with SwiftUI, the project demonstrates dynamic text input handling, advanced string manipulation, and data persistence techniques.  

## 📖 About the Project  
The game provides players with a random word, encouraging them to find as many other valid words as possible by rearranging its letters. This project is part of the Hacking with Swift series and is a great way to learn about string processing in Swift while building an interactive game.  

## 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Dynamic Word Challenges**: Players are presented with a random word and must create valid anagrams.  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Ensures user submissions are valid words, not duplicates, and derived from the given letters.  
- **High Score Tracking**: Tracks scores to motivate players to improve their vocabulary.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- Swift  
- SwiftUI 

## 💡 Key Learnings  
Working on **WordScramble** highlights:  
- Using `UITextChecker` to validate words.  
- Managing dynamic lists with `ForEach` in SwiftUI.  
- Combining Swift's `String` functions for powerful text manipulation.
